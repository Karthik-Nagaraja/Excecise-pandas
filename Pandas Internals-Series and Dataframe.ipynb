    "Apply() Logic Over the Columns in a Dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a dataframe object represents both rows and columns as Series objects. The apply() method in pandas allows us to specify Python logic that we want to evaluate over the Series objects in a dataframe. Here are some examples of what we can accomplish using the apply() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate the standard deviations for each numeric column\n",
    "    Lowercase all film names in the FILM column\n",
    "\n",
    "The apply() method requires us to pass in the vectorized operation we want to apply over each Series object. The method runs over the dataframe's columns by default, but we can use the axis parameter to change this (which we'll do later). If the vectorized operation usually returns a single value (such as the NumPy std() function), it will return a Series object containing the computed value for each column. If it usually returns a value for each element (such as multiplying or dividing by 2), it will transform all of the values and return them as a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, we select only the float columns, and assign the dataframe containing them to float_df. Then, we pass in the NumPy function std() as a lambda function to the dataframe method apply() in order to calculate the standard deviation of each column. Under the hood, pandas uses vectorized operations to apply the NumPy function for each iteration of the apply() method. It then returns a final Series object containing the standard deviations for each column (i.e., the film ratings)."
